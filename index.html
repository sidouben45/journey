          My journey in web development has been driven by hands-on projects and real-world problem-solving. Instead of just theoretical exercises, I focus on building functional and impactful applications step by step. Every challenge I take on strengthens my understanding of coding principles and best practices. My goal is to continuously refine my skills, work on meaningful projects, and stay updated with the latest industry trends. I believe that practical experience is the key to mastering development, and I am committed to learning through action
        </p>
        <p>
          After years of exploring different problem-solving approaches, I realized that the best way to grow as a developer is through continuous learning and hands-on experience. Every challenge I face sparks new ideas and pushes me to think creatively. Through trial and error, I have developed a strong problem-solving mindset, allowing me to turn concepts into functional and efficient solutions. Innovation and persistence drive my passion for technology, and I am always eager to take on new challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          My realization didn’t come in a dramatic moment—it was a natural conclusion from my experiences. The best way to learn and grow is through building real projects. Instead of isolated coding exercises, I focus on creating complete applications, each with structured challenges that reinforce key concepts. Every project I take on strengthens my problem-solving skills, adaptability, and ability to turn ideas into functional solutions. When faced with obstacles, I research, experiment, and refine my approach until I achieve the desired outcome.

          The main design challenge is taking what is currently paragraphs of explanation and instructions and packing them into a single test description text. Each project will involve dozens of tests like this. People will be coding the entire time, rather than switching back and forth from "reading mode" to "coding mode".
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of a series of coding challenges, people will be in their code editor passing one test after another, quickly building up a project. People will get into a real flow state, similar to what they experience when they build the required projects at the end of each certification. They'll get that sense of forward progress right from the beginning. And freeCodeCamp will be a much smoother experience.

          <p>Of the Curriculum</p>

              <p>
                We launched freeCodeCamp with a simple list of 15 resources,
                including Harvard's CS50 and Stanford's Database Class.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="list-subtitle">V2 - 2015</h4>
              <p>We added interactive algorithm challenges.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="list-subtitle">V3 - 2015</h4>
              <p>
                We added our own HTML+CSS challenges (before we'd been relying on
                General Assembly's Dash course for these).
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="list-subtitle">V4 - 2016</h4>
              <p>
                We expanded the curriculum to 3 certifications, including Front
                End, Back End, and Data Visualization. They each had 10 required
                projects, but only the Front End section had its own challenges.
                For the other certs, we were still using external resources like
                Node School.
              </p>

            <li>
              <h4 class="list-subtitle">V5 - 2017</h4>
              <p>We added the back end and data visualization challenges.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="list-subtitle">V6 - 2018</h4>
              <p>
                We launched 6 new certifications to replace our old ones. This was
                the biggest curriculum improvement to date.
