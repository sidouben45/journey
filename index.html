          My journey into web development began in 2022 when I first explored HTML and CSS. I graduated high school in 2023 and continued my learning at ENSTTIC University, where I am currently in my second year. Alongside my studies, I built real projects to enhance my skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the first projects I dedicated myself to was my personal portfolio website. I put a lot of effort into it, completing it within seven days. Through this project, I improved my design sense and ability to structure web pages effectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I progressed, I realized the importance of problem-solving in web development. Encountering challenges in projects, I developed strategies to debug issues, optimize code, and create more efficient solutions. While I sometimes use AI tools for assistance, I prefer to find solutions on my own first.

            Learning Through Projects: A Hands-On Approach

        <p>
          My realization didn’t come in a dramatic moment—it was a natural conclusion from my experiences. The best way to learn and grow is through building real projects. Instead of isolated coding exercises, I focus on creating complete applications, each with structured challenges that reinforce key concepts. Every project I take on strengthens my problem-solving skills, adaptability, and ability to turn ideas into functional solutions. When faced with obstacles, I research, experiment, and refine my approach until I achieve the desired outcome.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main design challenge is taking what is currently paragraphs of explanation and instructions and packing them into a single test description text. Each project will involve dozens of tests like this. People will be coding the entire time, rather than switching back and forth from "reading mode" to "coding mode".
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of a series of coding challenges, people will be in their code editor passing one test after another, quickly building up a project. People will get into a real flow state, similar to what they experience when they build the required projects at the end of each certification. They'll get that sense of forward progress right from the beginning. And freeCodeCamp will be a much smoother experience.

              <h4 class="list-subtitle">2022 - The Beginning</h4>
              <p>
                In 2022, I took my first steps into web development by learning the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. 
                I built simple static web pages, experimenting with different layouts, colors, and typography.
                 This phase was all about understanding the structure of web pages and how to style them effectively. 
                 At this point, I was mostly focused on self-learning through online tutorials and practicing by 
                 replicating existing websites.

              <h4 class="list-subtitle">2023 - College and Projects</h4>
              <p>After graduating high school, I joined ENSTTIC University, where I pursued studies related 
                to technology and engineering. Alongside my academic coursework, I worked on several personal
                 projects to improve my skills. One of my most significant achievements during this time was
                  creating my portfolio website, which allowed me to showcase my work and track my progress. 
                  This year also marked my transition from beginner-level knowledge to building real-world projects,
                   strengthening my problem-solving skills along the way.

              <h4 class="list-subtitle">2024 - Expanding My Skills</h4>
              <p>
                In 2024, I deepened my knowledge of web development by earning a FreeCodeCamp certification 
                in Responsive Web Design. This helped me gain a stronger grasp of modern CSS techniques, 
                such as Flexbox and Grid, to create more dynamic and adaptable designs. Additionally,
                 I started learning JavaScript, the key programming language that brings interactivity
                  to web applications. With JavaScript, I began working on simple interactive features
                   like form validation, dynamic content updates, and basic animations, making my web pages more engaging.

              <p>
                Started exploring JavaScript to enhance interactivity in my projects. My goal is to move beyond 
                static pages and develop fully functional web applications with interactive elements.
